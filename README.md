Implementing blockchain primitives

### Motivation, Goals, and Disclaimer

---
 I'm inspired by how one might design a zero-trust system and provably maintain its integrity throughout time.
 
This project aims to explore foundational concepts in building blockchains. This project
serves as a means to educate myself on understanding the building blocks of blockchain and
possibly incite new avenues for exploration.

That said, there is no long-term initiative to maintain and continuously develop this codebase. 
You are more than welcome to submit an issue or suggest improvements.
